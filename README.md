# MNIST_digit_recognizer
This Repository contains MNIST problem solved using 3 Method(Logistic Regression, Simple Neural network, Deep Learning Model)

### Softmax Regression:
First we have use Simple Multinominal Logistic Regression or Softmax Regression.
It is a generalization of Logistic regression for those cases where we want to handle multiple classes.

J(θ) = −[∑i=1m∑k=1K1{y(i)=k}logexp(θ(k)⊤x(i))∑Kj=1exp(θ(j)⊤x(i))]


### Simple Neural Network:

### Deep Learning Model:
