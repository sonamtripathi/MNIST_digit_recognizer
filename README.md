# MNIST_digit_recognizer
This Repository contains MNIST problem solved using 3 Method(Logistic Regression, Simple Neural network, Deep Learning Model)

### Softmax Regression:
First we have use Simple Multinominal Logistic Regression or Softmax Regression.
It is a generalization of Logistic regression for those cases where we want to handle multiple classes.

In Logistic Regression we assumed that the labels are binary: ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%5E%7B%28i%29%7D%20%5Cin%20%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D). We used such a classifier to distinguish between two kinds of hand-written digits.

Softmax Regression allows us to handle ![](y^{(i)} \in \{1,\ldots,K\}) where K is the number of Classes.



### Simple Neural Network:
